Welcome to Asimgit, please subscribe to my channel. I like my video. In this video, we will learn how to

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:13,840
apply the Flask app on Python Anywhere. After you log into your account on Python Anywhere,

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,040
then you can go to the web.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:32,160
And here you can click on Add New Web App. And this will be the domain or URL for your

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:43,280
web application. And then click on Next. And here you can select Python Web Framework. We are going

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:55,600
to go with the Flask and the Python version. I will select Python 3.10. And then you can see

7
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,440
Quick Start New Flask project. This file is your startup file or your Flask project.

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,920
And we just going to leave this name as it is. And then click on Next.

9
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:29,760
And now we can see all done. Your web app is now set up. And here is when you scroll down a bit,

10
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:38,640
you can see the source code pack 12 file. And this is our directory where our source code

11
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:47,200
is for our web application. And this is how we're working directory. And we can go to this

12
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,680
on my site from here. Or we can go back or here and click on Files.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,400
And under my site, you can see Flask app. And you can click on it.

14
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:19,840
And this is the default code for our Flask app. And you can also run from here your application.

15
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:36,160
And now our application is starting. And now we can test our web application and under

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,200
the web. This is the URL of my web application. I'm just going to click on this one.

17
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,760
And we get this message hello from Flask, which is the code over here. So this way you can

18
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:00,400
apply the Flask page application on Python anywhere. To keep on learning, please subscribe to
